  Send Telegram rich-media posts and reports via the bot (Bot API 10.2 sendRichMessage) - text, inline images, tables, headings, lists, quotes, collapsible blocks, formulas, collages/slideshows ALL in one message bubble. This is the REQUIRED transport for reports (see the red-banner rule in the persona). Also use when asked for a rich post, a message with images between text, a post with a table, "rich message", "картинка в середине текста". NOT for plain text replies (just answer) or simple albums.

# rich-post — Telegram rich messages via the bot

Send ONE message that mixes text, inline images, tables, headings, lists,
block quotes, collapsible blocks and formulas. This is `sendRichMessage`
(Bot API 10.2), not an album.

Album (sendMediaGroup) = up to 10 media, ONE caption, no text between images.
Rich message = up to 50 media, text/tables/blocks interleaved in a single
bubble. If the user wants "картинка в середине текста" or "таблица в посте" —
this skill.

## Standalone delivery quick start

Skip this section entirely in embedded renderer mode.

All paths are relative to the repo root (the agent's working directory).

```bash
python3 agent/skills/rich-post/scripts/send_rich.py --md-file /tmp/post.md
```

- Recipient: by default the message goes to `TELEGRAM_DIGEST_CHAT_ID` from
  `.env`. An explicit `--chat <id>` is accepted ONLY if the id is allowlisted
  (`TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER_IDS` + `TELEGRAM_DIGEST_CHAT_ID`) — the recipient of
  a report is the owner's setting, not the model's choice. Anything else is
  refused without sending.
- `--md` / `--md-file` — markdown content (`--md-file -` reads stdin).
- `--dry-run` — OFFLINE check: validates the markdown and image paths, prints
  the result; nothing is uploaded or sent. Always run this first.
- `--allow-upload` — see «Local images» below. Off by default.
- `--silent`, `--thread-id` — optional.
- Token: `$TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` or the repo `.env`. There is NO `--token` flag
  (argv is visible in the process list) — don't put the token on the command line.

## Embedded renderer mode

Another skill may explicitly select **embedded renderer mode** when it already owns
the current Eve reply. In that mode, return exactly one normal reply containing
Rich Markdown. Include at least one native-rich construct — a table, task list,
`<details>` block, or block formula — so the Telegram channel selects
`sendRichMessage`.

Do not create a temporary file and do not call `send_rich.py` in embedded renderer
mode. Do not send a second confirmation. The current Eve turn owns delivery,
outbound redaction, success accounting, and the HTML/plain fallback.

## Local images — read before using

Telegram accepts ONLY public URLs for rich-message media (`attach://` and
multipart upload fail with `RICH_MESSAGE_PHOTO_URL_INVALID`). So a local image
referenced as `![](file:/abs/path "caption")` must first be uploaded to a
public host. The script uses **tmpfiles.org — an anonymous PUBLIC host**:
anyone with the link can open the file while it lives there.

Because of that:

- uploads happen only with the explicit `--allow-upload` flag; without it,
  local images are an error (and `--dry-run` merely lists what WOULD be
  uploaded);
- only real media passes the gate: regular files with an image/video/audio
  extension (jpg/png/gif/webp/mp4/webm/mov/mp3/ogg/m4a), located inside the
  repo or the data dir, with no hidden dot-segment in the path. `.env`, OAuth
  json, logs, vault `.md` and any other text file are refused even with
  `--allow-upload` — a report must not be able to exfiltrate server files;
- never reference private documents as images anyway. If in doubt — don't
  upload; send text instead.

Telegram fetches and caches the media at send time, so the temp URL expiring
afterwards is fine.

## Standalone delivery workflow

Skip this section entirely in embedded renderer mode.

1. **Write content** in markdown (see syntax below) to a temp file.
2. **`--dry-run`** to verify layout and image paths (offline).
3. **Send** — to the default digest chat, or an allowlisted `--chat`. For
   images add `--allow-upload` consciously (see above). Confirm with the user
   before posting anywhere beyond the current conversation.

## Limits

- 32768 UTF-8 chars total (incl. emoji alt text + formula source)
- 500 blocks (nested blocks, list items, table rows, quotes, details count)
- 16 levels of nesting
- 50 media attachments total (photos + videos + audio)
- 20 columns per table

## Gotchas (learned)

- Images need a **public URL**. `attach://` and multipart upload → 400
  `RICH_MESSAGE_PHOTO_URL_INVALID`.
- Use `rich_message.markdown` OR `rich_message.html`, exactly one.
- Channels/groups: the bot must be admin with permission to send media (and
  the target still has to be allowlisted).
- The host promotes a normal reply only when it contains a native-rich construct.
  Standalone rich posts still use this script; workflows in embedded renderer mode
  return their Rich Markdown through the current Eve turn instead.
